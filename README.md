# ðŸ“¦ Project Archived

**This project has been superseded by a completely new MCP server.**

## New MCP Server

A new, completely rewritten MCP server is now available at:

**ðŸ”— https://github.com/wshobson/maverick-mcp**

## What This Means

- This repository (`mcp-trader`) is now archived and will no longer receive updates
- The new repository contains a completely new MCP server with enhanced capabilities
- This is not a migration of the same codebase, but rather a fresh implementation

## Getting Started with the New Server

To use the new MCP server:

1. **Clone the new repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wshobson/maverick-mcp.git
   ```

2. **Follow the setup instructions** in the new repository's README

3. **Update your Claude Desktop configuration** to use the new server

4. **Star/watch the new repository** to stay updated with the latest features

## Thank You

Thank you for your interest in this project. The new MCP server offers enhanced capabilities and a completely fresh implementation!
